## Introduction
After briefly going through the IMDB movie dataset, one can start to notice some correlations or trends between various characteristics of the movie. The pertinent business question that any Data Analyst would ask when browsing through this data set is to find out what characteristics of movies produce the highest revenue. This investigation and research would help the film industry to work on those characteristics that would generate the highest revenue and by extension increase the movies popularity.

It is due to these above mentioned reasons, that I have decided to keep one major overaching question that would drive the entire investigation and from which other sub-questions and trends would be discovered.

The focus of our investigation would revolve around

"What characterstics and traits of a movie generate higher revenue". Is their a positive correlation between one characterstic and revenue and can one conclude that this correlation might also be defined as causation?

From this other subquestions can be derived and various other trends explored for example:

1- Profit Trends of movies over time to find the most profitable movie

2- Average runtime of the movies

3- Popular genres which is mostly watched

4- Budget, revenue, and profit distribution: maximum and minimum budget and revenue

## Findings
The average revenue generated from the movies are much greater than the budget used for the movies. Moreover, revenue gradually increases over the years. Robert De Niro and Bruce Willis are the casting members who has appeared most number of time.The average movie running time of most number of movies were higher.The Drama genre hold the most number of movies watched followed by comedy.It can be also observed that the number of movie released is increasing over the time. As for profit, the average profit increased in the last few years. However, there are some limitations. As statistical methods are not used to infer information and only basic visualizations are used, the observations may not be accurate.some rows are deleted from data set due to non existent values , this may effect the analysis and USD is considered as common currency for columns reveneu and budget. This may effect the profit trend of movies over the years.
